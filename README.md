# Unsupervised Learning
## Project: Customer Segmentation Using Unsupervised Learning

### Install

This project requires **Python 3.x** and the following Python libraries installed:

- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [Pandas](http://pandas.pydata.org)
- [matplotlib](http://matplotlib.org/)
- [scikit-learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/)
- [seaborn](https://seaborn.pydata.org/)

## Introduction 

In this project, I applied unsupervised learning techniques to identify segments of the population that form the core customer base for a mail-order sales company in Germany. These segments can then be used to direct marketing campaigns towards audiences that will have the highest expected rate of returns. 

## Data Source
The data that has been provided by Bertelsmann Arvato Analytics, and represents a real-life data science task.

## Analysis Steps
I used exploratory data analysis to understand the following:
- What kind of feaures are available in the dataset?
- Missing data patterns.
- Identify outliers.
- Preporocess and clean the data for ML analysis.
- Create customer segments using unsupervised tools from scikit-learn.

## Results
